## Summary
Heartbeat Wristband is a heartbeat detector with an illuminated effect. For the exerciseholic, they need a heartbeat Wristband to get a reminder of heart rate and have fun with workout time. The goal is to create a wristband to detect the heartbeat and reminds users when the heartbeat is above his/her maximum heart rate. Users can customize their maximum heart rate, and the vibration motor will vibrate when their heartbeat reach this maximum number, at the same time, users' pulse can display with NeoPixels. 
The first thing I consider is how to connect pulse sensor with some output and what kinds of output should I use. I considered vibration motor, neo-pixel, and LCD. I connected pulse sensor with adafruit flora to make sure it can read heatbeat and change the heartbeat. Then, I connected pulse sensor with vibration motor and adjust what the maximum heart rate I want to set up. I also adjust the code to connect the pulse sensor with neo-pixel and LCD. I thought LCD is too trick to connect the adfruit flora. As a result, I chose one input(pulse sensor) and two output(vibration motor), and neo-pixel to compelete my final Heartbeat Wristband.
## Component Parts
	- 1 × Adafruit FLORA 
	- 1 × Pulse sensor
	- 8 × Flora RGB Smart NeoPixel 
	- 1 × Lily vibration motor
	- USB serial

## Challenge
1. The most tricky part is how to make vibration and neo-pixel works as the same time.
2. How to detect pulse sensor in human body except ear and finger. 

## Things I consider 
What can I detect with a sensor? What are its limitations? Do those opportunities and limitations work with my concept?
How can I embed as much as humanism in my design
How can I make technology unobtrusive, or even artistic
Physical data visualization
