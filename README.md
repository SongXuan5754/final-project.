## Summary
Heartbeat Wristband is a heartbeat detector with an illuminated effect. 
The goal is to create a wristband to detect heartbeat and remind users when 
the heartbeat is above maximum rate. Users can customize their maximum heart rate, and the vibration motor will vibrates when heartbeat reach the maximum number, at the same time, users' pulse can display with NeoPixels. 
## Component Parts
	- 1 × Adafruit FLORA 
	- 1 × Pulse sensor
	- 8 × Flora RGB Smart NeoPixel 
	- 1 × Lily vibration motor
	- USB serial

## Challenge
1. The most tricky part is how to make vibration and neo-pixel works as the same time.
2. How to detect pulse sensor in human body except ear and finger. 
## Things I consider 
What can I detect with a sensor? What are its limitations? Do those opportunities and limitations work with my concept?
How can I embed as much as humanism in my design
How can I make technology unobtrusive, or even artistic
Physical data visualization
